# 15-min-wage
An in depth look into the impact raising the minimum wage has on a city 

The data set used in this project was collected by the bureau of labor statistics and was combined together using a spread sheet.

The goal of this project is to both visualize the data and analyze correlation between the independent variable of cities that raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and the standard of living in that city.
The standard of living is defined by the unemployment rate, food cost, and cost of living in the city. 

The goal of this project is to have a presentable r shiny application which does linear regression analysis and residual analysis of major cities which will include both cities that have raised the minimum wage and those that have not.

This project looks to see if raising the minimum wage does in fact raise the standard of living in American cities.
